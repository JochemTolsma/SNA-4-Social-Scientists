<p>The smallest possible social network is a network between two persons (or, more precisely, between two social agents). A network between two persons is also called a dyad. In the clip below I will introduce you to the the main concepts involved in a dyad. Naturally, the same concepts also play a role in larger social networks.</p>

<p>For slides, see <a href="dyads.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After having watched the video you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>give a definition of a dyad.<br />
</li>
<li>explain what is meant by time-varying and time-constant actor attributes and dyad attributes.<br />
</li>
<li>explain that relations between ego and alter can be classified based on whether relations are directed or undirected and on the level of measurement of the relation (i.e. nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).<br />
</li>
<li>be familiar with al the synonyms for networks, agents and relations.<br />
</li>
<li>provide examples of dyads, and the relations between ego and alter.<br />
</li>

Scholars in this field try to explain why two people in an exclusive relationship like marriage (or cohabition or best friends) are more similar to one another with respect to defining characteristics (e.g. social class, ethnicity) than two random persons. Assortative mating is a special case of <strong>homophily</strong>. Assortative mating is an important topic within sociology because it is, next to social mobility, an important indicator of the <strong>openness of society</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Selection</strong> and <strong>influence</strong> processes are important reasons why partners (ego and alter) within a dyad are more similar than two random persons. We may prefer to marry someone who is similar to us on key social dimensions, share our attitudes and opinions and show similar behavior. Once married we may influence each other and assimilate to one another. A third reason why we observe homophily within couples is that partners are likely to have shared and will share the <strong>same social context</strong>. With shared social context we mean the shared social and physical environment and shared life experiences. The environment pre-marriage may in part determine characteristics of the pool of potential marriage partners (i.e. the choice set). For example when neighbourhoods and schools are segregated along ethnic and educational division lines, the potential marriage partners we meet are likely to be more similar to us than a random person in society at large. The shared social environment post-marriage may exert a similar influence on both partners, consider for example economic recession’s effects on different geographic regions. This may impact the job opportunities for both partners similarly (assuming they live in the same house). An example of shared life experiences, would be having children.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that causes and consequences of homophily are closely related. A shared social context and partner preferences may predict (or cause) homophily within dyads. But once a dyad is formed, a consequence of this relationship may be that partnes become more similar over time, as a result of a shared environment, influence and (de)selection processes. If you want to disentangle these processes, it is necessarry to have information on the degree of homophily between potential marriage partners would they be randomly assigned to one another, the degree of homophily at the beginning of the union, the degree of homophily within couples after a specific time period.</p>

You will also come across the terms:
- baseline or structural homophily: this is the degree of homophily we observe simply as a result of the composition of the total choice set, the people with whom we can, in principle, form a relationship.<br />
- inbreeding homophily: this is the degree of homophily we observe over and above the level of baseline homophily. This may be caused by taste homophily and differences in resources and restrictions (other than set by the total choice set).<br />
- taste or choice homophily: the extent of homophily induced by personal preferences.<br />

<dd><p>The openness of society refers to the level of inequality of opportunities within society. The social problem of inequality consists of two sub-problems. The first refers to inequality in outcomes: the unequal distribution of resources (e.g. economic, cultural, social, knowledge, power). The second refers to inquality in opportunities, the association between specific individual or group charactersitics and the likelihood to obtain these resources. Here the opennes of society is clearly linked to the second sub-problem. Where in questions of (inter-generational) social mobility the association between social position of parents and the social position of children is assessed, within the literature on intermarriage the association between the social positions of the two spouses is assessed. Both questions or associations will tell you something about the strenght of class/social position boundaries.</p>

<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>The GTF is a framework, not a theory from which you can deduce hypotheses.</strong></span> Before we can do that, we need to fill in the blanks. That is, we need to make the social contexts (bridge assumptions) explicit. We need a Theory of Action. We need to think of the interdependencies and how they impact the aggregation mechanism.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started…</p>
<div id="social-context-effects" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Social context effects</h4>
<p><strong>Characteristics of the social context</strong> in which people are embedded (the marco- and meso-level) may impact people’s preferences and resources.<br />
Example 1: The level of economic inequality impacts how financial resources are unequally distributed across educational groups within society.<br />
Hypo1: In countries with more wealth inequality, the difference between educational groups in economic resources is larger.<br />
Example 2: Societal norms may impact your own views and opinions and thus preferences.<br />
Hypo2: In countries with more equal gender norms, men’s (women’s) preferences for a partner with a higher education are stronger (weaker).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-special-role-of-restrictions" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>The special role of restrictions</h4>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong> or constraints also refer to macro-level characteristics but restrictions do not directly impact preferences and resources (i.e. choice input) but instead influence, or <em>constrain</em> how these preferences and resources lead to choice-output; we have a constrained choice model. Restrictions - in studies on the emergence of social networks - impact the <em>choice-set</em>, the relevant choice-options that a person has.<br />
If I would like to marry a grizzly bear but if there are no grizzly bears around which I can marry, I cannot act upon my preferences (commonly the example is about Eskimos but that may be considered more politically incorrect). This is called a <em>structural restriction</em>. A more realistic example would be the distribution of educational degrees within society, which depend on educational expansion and inequality of educational opportunities.<br />
Next, to structural restrictions we may also have <em>normative restrictions</em>, the formal and informal rules of institutions. A formal normative restriction would be a <em>law</em> that forbids me to marry a grizzly bear. An informal normative restriction would be a <em>social norm</em>, e.g. my parents who disapprove of my preference to marry a grizzly bear.<br />
Please note that social norms may thus impact my preferences directly (a social context effect) and indirectly (act as a restriction).
Example1: Preferences for a partner with a similar educational level are more likely to lead to educational homogamy, if educational degrees are more evenly distributed across men and women.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">In the literature on resources you will see that restrictions are also commonly understood as the absence of resources. I am a stubborn scientists and DO NOT FOLLOW THIS TERMINOLOGY and neither should you.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="theory-of-action" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Theory of Action</h4>
<p>Persons have <strong>preferences</strong> for a partner with a specific educational-level. Commonly, people prefer higher-educated partners (because of instrumental motives) and people have homomphilic preferences. Preferences may differ between persons with different educational levels and between men and women.<br />
Persons also have <strong>resources</strong> (i.e. economic, cultural, cognitive, social resources) that may affect the search behavior of persons. 
Example1: persons with more economic resources have more options to meet different people and may thus select a partner from a larger choice-set.
Hypo1: persons with more economic resources are more likely to marry a partner that meet their preferences, i.e. a more similar partner.</p>
<p>We would like to apply the GTF to explain the emergence of social networks. The networks we observe are the result of people making and breaking social relations. Consequently, a theory of action to explain decision about social relations should explain not only decisions about making new relations (i.e. <strong>selection</strong>) but also about decision whether or not to maintain or break existing relations (i.e. <strong>deselection</strong>). When we talk about selection processess, we implicitly mean both selection and deselection. <br />
Concretely, if we want to explain the degree of intermarriage within society, we need to take into account both who is marrying whom <em>and</em> who is divorcing whom! Consider the following example. For some people the saying ‘opposite attracts’ may hold true and they may be unaware of or ignore the social norm not to intermarry. But once married the couple may face unanticipated sanctions of violating the social norm, they may be ostracized. Being faced with this unanticipated consequence of their marriage decision, the couple may subsequently decide to divorce. In this example, the social norm thus not influences the selection process (more precisely, does not moderate the impact of preferences on marriage decisions) but it does influence the deselection process. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Theory of Action assumes a cost benefit evaluation of some sort, in line with Rational Action Theory. However, social scientists’ view on human’s rationality is different than the view of classical economists. Social scientists speak of restricted or bounded rationality (i.e. a weak rationality assumption); people are not always able to have or process all relevant information to make accurate and correct cost-benefit evaluations. We make questimates about the costs involved in our decision and about the likelihood that our behavior will yield the desired goal. Within sociology, actor’s goals are not only economic, monatory goals. Actor’s goals can be physical and social goals (i.e. health, happiness, avoidance of downwards mobility). For a nice paper on Rational Action Theory for Sociologists, see <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-goldthorpe1998" role="doc-biblioref">Goldthorpe 1998</a>)</span>.</p>

</div>
<div id="transformation-rules" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Transformation rules</h4>
<p>We now almost have all ingredients to explain (or predict) the degree of intermarriage in society. We ‘only’ need the aggregation mechanisms: the micro-to-macro link. We thereby need to know the macro-level (intended and unintended) consequences of individual actions. That is, we need to know how the marriage market functions. </p>
<p>Let us assume the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone takes the initiative. This is determined by chance.</li>
<li>The initial choice-set is formed by 5 random partners of the opposite sex (no assumptions about search behavior). Possible partners who are already married are removed from the initial choice-set. The possible partners that remain constitute the (final) choice set.<br />
</li>
<li>Persons may prefer a partner with a higher education. These preferences may differ between educational levels and between the sexes.</li>
<li>Persons choose a partner from their choice set (not marrying is not an option). Possible partners with a higher education have a larger chance to be chosen. How important a partner’s education is, depends on the preference of the one taking the initiative.</li>
<li>The persons who is being proposed to always accepts.</li>
<li>We observe no divorces.</li>
<li>Resources do not play any role (e.g the higher educated do not have a larger choice set)</li>
<li>Educational degrees are either ‘high’ or ‘low.’</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above marriage-market model we have a limited number of ingredients that impact the observed degree of educational intermarriage within society:</p>
<ul>
<li>gender composition within society<br />
</li>
<li>the distribution of educational degrees in society<br />
</li>
<li>preferences<br />
</li>
<li>the number of marriage proposals</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you see that marriage choices are interdependent. If I marry person A, you no longer can marry person A.
These interdependencies make it difficult to predict the macro-level dependent variable, degree of educational homogamy. </p>
<p>Given the market model above, can you predict who will marry whom?</p>
<p>Well, I can not. You may be a mathematical wizard and able to find a closed solution by some algebra. Another option could be to to make a simplified model and try to simulate the macro-level outcome based purely on our micro-level theory of action and the rules of the marriage market. We call this Agent-Based-Modelling (see <!---and some nice refs--->). I programmed a simply ABM based on the above. There are some parameters in the model which you can change.</p>
<p>Suppose…</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>**%_men=50**: We have an equal gender distribution in society (50% men, 50% women; range: 1-99).<br />
</li>
<li>**_men_EducHigh=50**: 50% of our male population is higher educated and 50% is lower educated (range: 1-99).<br />
</li>
<li>**_women_EducHigh=50**: 50% of our female population is higher educated and 50% is lower educated (range: 1-99).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>pref_men_EH=0</strong>: Higher educated men do not have any preference with respect to the educational level of their partner. (range: 0-10)</li>
<li><strong>pref_men_EL=0</strong>: Lower educated men do not have any preference with respect to the educational level of their partner. (range: 0-10)</li>
<li><strong>pref_women_EH=0</strong>: Higher educated women do not have any preference with respect to the educational level of their partner. (range: 0-10)</li>
<li><strong>pref_women_EL=0</strong>: Lower educated women do not have any preference with respect to the educational level of their partner. (range: 0-10)</li>
</ol>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Causes of dyads (methods)</h3>
<p>When testing hypotheses on assortative mating two methodological approaches can be used. We may predict the <strong>frequency of specific dyads</strong> in our population with loglinear models and the data we use is commonly structured in a table like the one below.</p>
<p><strong>Table.</strong> Dyad frequencies</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>Wife educ-high</th>
<th>Wife educ-low</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Husband educ-high</strong></td>
<td>350</td>
<td>150</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Husband educ-low</strong></td>
<td>200</td>
<td>400</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Another approach is to take the <strong>characteristics of the dyad</strong> (e.g. endogamy versus mixed) as the dependent variable. This dependent variable can than be explained by applying (conditional) (multinomial) logistic regression techniques. In this case, the data is commonly structured in long format and looks something like the table below.</p>
<p><strong>Table.</strong> Dyad characteristics</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Dyad_id</th>
<th>Wife educ</th>
<th>Husband educ</th>
<th>dyad_educ</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>high</td>
<td>low</td>
<td>high-low</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<tr class="even">

<p>Which methodology is preferred should depend on your hypotheses and on the data you have to your availability. Since I assume most readers are raised within the regression tradition, in [this section] we will practice with estimating conditional multinomial logistic regression models.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please be aware that in both approaches we normally do not have information on (the frequency or characteristics of) dyads in which there is no relation between ego and alter. Thus, you may have information on characteristics of me and my wife but you do not have information on all other women (or men) I could have married but didn’t. I fished my wife out of the sea but we don’t know what the other fish looked like. (Luckily my wife is no scientist and won’t read this clarification.)</p>

<div id="consequences-of-dyads-theory" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Consequences of dyads (theory)</h2>
<p>Assortative mating, or more generally mating, has consequences for both partners. Just to mention a few: relationship quality; time spend together on culture consumption; divorce rates; number of children; household income; working hours. I hope you see that these concepts all refer to the dyad-level but that you may group these concepts by how they are measured, namely at the dyad-level itself (yes/no divorce, number of children) or at the ego/alter-level and aggregated to the dyad-level (e.g. total working hours of the couple is the sum of the working hours of both individual partners, culture consumption is the consumed culture of both partners (alone and together)). But with both type of concepts, it should be clear that they are the consequence of interdependent actions of both partners (e.g. commonly both partners decide on whether to have and make children).</p>
<p>Thus, once again, homophily within couples may be the result of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>selection</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>shared context</strong></li>
<li><strong>(dyadic) influence</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>But what do we mean with ‘influence?’ Let’s read the following quote.</p>
<p class="quote">
People influence one another, and as the importance and immediacy of a group or individual increases, this influence becomes stronger (Latané, 1981). Forces of influence are especially strong within romantic relationships because these relationships are important, are predicated on mutual acceptance, and involve frequent exposure to the habits of one’s partner." <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-bartel2017romantic" role="doc-biblioref">Bartel et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-bartel2017romantic" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>
</p>
<p>It would say this a quite naive conceptualisation of <strong>influence</strong>. It is implicitly assumed that partners will match their opinions/behaviors. Thus influence here is convergence. But why should partners’ characteristics converge over time, why would homophily increase? And, it still does not become clear what the ‘forces of influence’ are.</p>
<p>Let us make a distinction between:</p>
<ul>
<li>positive influence: alters become more similar to each other over time<br />
</li>
<li>negative influence: alters become more distinct to each other over time</li>
<li>positive feedback influence: characteristics develop in same direction over time</li>
</ul>
<p>Now suppose these influence processes are the only reasons why alters change (i.e. the <em>ceteris paribus</em> condition). How could dyad similarity develop over time. See below:</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.3: Positive feedback influence
</p>
</div>
<p>There are several ‘forces of positive influence mechanisms’:</p>
<ul>
<li>information: We may exchange new effective information and arguments with our alters.</li>
<li>persuasion (and dissuasion): we may convince, force or pressure our alters to become similar to us.<br />
</li>
<li>contagion: this can be taken quite literally, like how the flu spreads but also more metaphorically like how (health) behaviors like drinking, smoking, sporting spread (because our alters increase the opportunities for these behaviors).<br />
</li>
<li>assimilation: we may mimic our alters because of a psychological need for similarity, because we think this will be good for our identity / social status, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: red;">The literature is not very clear and consistent about different type of incluence processes and which influence mechanisms are at play. You will thus also see that authors use socialisation when talking about (positive) influence processes. </span></p>
<p>There are several ‘forces of negative influence mechanisms’:</p>
<ul>
<li>information: We may exchange new counter-effective information and arguments with our alters. This would especially become relevant whey we don’t like or belief the source of information and arguments.<br />
</li>
<li>persuasion (and dissuasion): we may convince, force or pressure our alters to become dissimilar to us.</li>
<li>polarisation: we may distance ourselves from our alters because of a psychological need for distinctiveness. This would especially become relevant when we are already distinct on key social dimensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several ‘forces of positive feedback influence mechanisms’:</p>
<ul>
<li>confirmation: information and arguments are repeated and existing opinions and behaviors of both alters reinforced.<br />
</li>
<li>competition: we may have a psychological need to be better/higher/more than our alter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The crucial difference between the positive feedback mechanisms and the positive influence mechanisms are that as a result of the former homophily between the alters does not necessarily change. Note that positive feedback could entail increasing and decreasing the opinion or behavior.</p>

<div id="consequences-of-dyads-methods" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Consequences of dyads (methods)</h2>
<p>The method used to explain consequences of dyads depends on our Unit of Analysis. If it is the dyad itself (e.g. mean relationship quality) methods are relatively straightforward, because we may assume that the observations at the dyad-level are independent. If, on the other hand, the unit of analysis are the partners themselves that make up the dyad, we need to acknowledge that the observations between the partners of the same couple are not independent. In part exactly because partners select and influence each other and share a social context. One solution could be to simply randomly select one partner of each couple or, if partners can be clearly distinguished - for example men and women in heterosexual couples - the different partners could be analyzed separately. A disadvantage of the latter two approaches is, however, that the covariance between the partners cannot be explained anymore, although this may exactly be the focus of our research questions. A more elegant solution, is to take the interdependencies into account and model these explicitly. This can be done within a multi-level framework and within a structural-equation modelling framework.</p>
<p>When we discussed the methods to analyze causes of homogamy, we were interested in homophily within couples at one point in time and focus on selection as explanans. Now, when we discuss the consequences of dyads, we are interested in explaining trends in homophily within couples and focus on shared context and influence processes as explanans.</p>
