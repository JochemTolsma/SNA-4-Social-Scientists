# Prerequisites

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

# Introduction {#intro}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

## Getting up and running

* install the latest version of R: [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* install the latest version of RStudio: [RStudio](www.rstudio.com) 
* open RStudio and follow a brief tour/tutorial
  + [brief tour of Gulzar](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~gulzar/rstudio/basic-tutorial.html)
  + lot of youtube videos for RStudio  
  + check out the tutorials at [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/) 
  + or here: https://data-flair.training/blogs/exporting-data-from-r/
  + and of course at Rstudio and CRAN
  

Open RStudio. Your screen will look something like this: 


**Figure 1. Screenshot**[]{#anchor}
![Figure 1. Screenshot](screenshot.PNG) 


* I will show you around the major subwindows and taps in RStudio. 


## Working with RScript  

* Open a new R-script (via file --> new --> RScript ([**Arrow 1, Figure 1**](#anchor)), or simply hit *Ctrl+Shift+N*)
  
- Make sure to start your script with your name, date.    
- Always make to start with a clean workspace.  
- Load the additional packages you will need later.  
- Always make sure to start with the latest versions of R and your packages.  
- Always define your workdirectory.    

Thus your RScript will look something like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
###########################
# Title: Tutorial CSR
# Author: J Tolsma
# version: 30-10-2019
###########################

#start with clean workspace 
rm(list=ls())

#install.packages I will need later here
install.packages("installr") #you  first install packages
require(installr) #then you will need to load them. This package is used to simply update R
install.packages("foreign")
require(foreign) #used to read in spss data files

#update if necessarry
updateR()

#define workdirectory, note the double backslashes
setwd('C:\\SNA-4-Social-Scientists\\') #change to your own workdirectory

```


Do you see I start some lines with a `#` these lines are comments and not code/commands. This is similar as the `*` sign in SPSS.  
To run some code, you place your cursor in the line and hit *Ctrl+Enter*. You may also select the code you want to run, or copy and paste it directly in the console window ([**Arrow 2, Figure 1**](#anchor)). To see which commands you have executed, you may want to have a look at the history tab ([**Arrow 3, Figure 1**](#anchor))). 

> Hint 1: In the upper right corner of the code blocks you see a *copy-and-paste* sign. You may use this to copy and paste the code of this tutorial in your own script.  
> Hint 2: You really want to learn R? Never ever copy and paste code. Type the code yourself. 


## Installing additional packages    
You will probably always need to load and/or install additional packages. You may want to use RStudio's functionality ([**Arrow 4, Figure1**](#anchor)). I normally prefer to put everyting in my script. See for example in the code block above, line 9 to 12. 

## I don't understand the code!!
When you see `functionname()` it means we use a build-in function of R
If you want to see how lines/commands/functions work, try to decipher them from the inside out. Thus if you want to dechiper `rm(list=ls())`:  

* `ls()`
* `list=ls()`
* `list`  

Let's give it a go: 
```{r, results}
tesvariable <- 4
ls()
list=ls()
list
ls()
rm(list)
ls()
#? :-)
rm(list=ls())
ls()

```
  
If you want to know more about specific functions, try to use the help function. 
For example try the following:  

* `?ls`  
* `?rm`  

At first it will be difficult to read the R Documentation pages. Don't worry, you will get the hang of it.

## Reading in data files

We are going to work with two datasets you used during the lecture: "Culturele Veranderingen". For more information on these datasets, see [here](https://www.scp.nl/Onderzoek/Bronnen/Beknopte_onderzoeksbeschrijvingen/Culturele_veranderingen_in_Nederland_CV).

Please download the files to your working directory. 

Cultural Changes_2008.sav:
```{r includecv08, echo=FALSE}
xfun::pkg_load2(c("htmltools", "mime"))
xfun::embed_file('Cultural Changes_2008.sav') 
```
