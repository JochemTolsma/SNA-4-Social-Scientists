# (PART) Part 2 EGONETS {-} 

# Theory  






We already introduced egonets in section \@ref(types). We defined an egonet as the **set of ties surrounding sampled individual units.** [cf. @marsden1990]. Thus we have an ego with ties to one or more alters. If we also know the ties between our alters we may observe triads. In the figure below I have made the <span style='color: green;'>triad green</span>.

Let us discuss this important network structure in some more detail first, before we move on with our discussion on Egonets. 

## Network Structures (TRIAD) {#triad}

Let us start with all possible triad configurations if we have a (binary) undirected tie. See Figure \@ref(fig:ut).

We observe an *unconnected* triad, a triad with a *connected pair*, an *open triad* and a *closed triad*. The open triad is also called a 'forbidden triad' and actor *i* in such a triad is said to hold a 'brokerage position'.

>How many isomorphs can you think of for a triad with one *connected pair*?  

We only have three nodes but network structures become complex quite quickly. See Figure @\ref(mut) for the many possible configurations for triads when we consider two different type of undirected ties (i.e. multiplexity).

By now, I am a bit tired of drawing all these nodes and relations. Luckily, the net is full of pictures of the possible directed triad configurations. I stole this one from an online workshop on Social Network Analysis for Anthropologists [here](https://eehh-stanford.github.io/SNA-workshop/).

</div>

These triads all have unique names: 

* last digit: number of dyads without ties  
* second digit: number of dyads with one tie  
* first digit: number of dyads with two ties (mutual dyads)  
* specific subtype:  
  - C: cyclic
  - D: downward  
  - U: upward  
  - T: transitive

This triad census has been developed by @davis1967 and their original picture in the paper is too cool not to show here:

I could not find a nice picture of all possible directed triad configurations for two relations simultaneously. If you have time on your hands, please make one for me! ðŸ˜€ 

So, let us move on to egonets.
