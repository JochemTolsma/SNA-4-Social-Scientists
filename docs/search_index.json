[["theory.html", "Chapter 3 Theory 3.1 Network Structures (TRIAD) 3.2 Causes 3.3 Consequences", " Chapter 3 Theory We already introduced egonets in section 1.4.1. We defined an egonet as the set of ties surrounding sampled individual units. (cf. Marsden 1990). Thus we have an ego with ties to one or more alters. If we also know the ties between our alters we may observe triads. In the figure below I have made the triad green. Figure 3.1: A Triad within an egonet Let us discuss this important network structure in some more detail first, before we move on with our discussion on Egonets. 3.1 Network Structures (TRIAD) Let us start with all possible triad configurations if we have a (binary) undirected tie. See Figure 3.2. Figure 3.2: undirected triad configurations We observe an unconnected triad, a triad with a connected pair, an open triad and a closed triad. The open triad is also called a forbidden triad and actor i in such a triad is said to hold a brokerage position. How many isomorphs can you think of for a triad with one connected pair? We only have three nodes but network structures become complex quite quickly. See Figure @(mut) for the many possible configurations for triads when we consider two different type of undirected ties (i.e.Â multiplexity). Figure 3.3: Multiplex, undirected triad configurations By now, I am a bit tired of drawing all these nodes and relations. Luckily, the net is full of pictures of the possible directed triad configurations. I stole this one from an online workshop on Social Network Analysis for Anthropologists here. Figure 3.4: Directed triad configurations These triads all have unique names: last digit: number of dyads without ties second digit: number of dyads with one tie first digit: number of dyads with two ties (mutual dyads) specific subtype: C: D: U: T: . This triad census has been developed by Davis and Leinhardt (1967) and their original picture in the paper is too cool not to show here: Figure 3.5: Original Triad census by Davis and Leinhard (1967) I could not find a nice picture of all possible directed triad configurations for two relations simultaneously. If you have time on your hands, please make one for me!  So, let us move on to egonets. 3.2 Causes 3.3 Consequences References "],["methods-1.html", "Chapter 4 Methods 4.1 Before you start 4.2 Causes 4.3 Consequences", " Chapter 4 Methods 4.1 Before you start 4.2 Causes 4.2.1 Aggregation 4.2.2 Disaggregation 4.2.3 Micro-macro Model 4.2.3.1 Multi-level framework 4.2.3.2 SEM 4.3 Consequences 4.3.1 Macro-micro model 4.3.1.1 Multi-level framework 4.3.1.2 SEM 4.3.2 Micro-macro-RI-CLPM "],["data-1.html", "Chapter 5 Data 5.1 Sampling 5.2 Ethical considerations 5.3 Measurement 5.4 Causes 5.5 Consequences 5.6 Causes 5.7 Consequences 5.8 Sampling 5.9 Ethical considerations 5.10 Measurement 5.11 Chapter overview 5.12 Promises and pitfalls 5.13 Best of both worlds? 5.14 Where does this lead us? 5.15 Ethics 5.16 Webscraping techniques 5.17 Hands-on webscraping 18 Preliminary notes 19 Getting up and running 20 Working with RScript 21 Installing additional packages 22 I dont understand the code!! 23 Reading in data files 24 Define missings 25 Recoding variables 26 Means and counting specific values 27 Merging data files 28 Aggregate data 29 Missing values 30 Very important stuff!! 31 Assignment 32 Variance and covariance 33 Intraclass correlation", " Chapter 5 Data 5.1 Sampling 5.2 Ethical considerations 5.3 Measurement 5.4 Causes 5.5 Consequences 5.6 Causes 5.7 Consequences 5.8 Sampling 5.9 Ethical considerations 5.10 Measurement 5.11 Chapter overview 5.11.1 Definitions 5.12 Promises and pitfalls 5.12.1 Promises (Social) networks Dynamics Signals Size 5.12.2 Pitfalls Sampling Size Thin Data structure 5.13 Best of both worlds? 5.14 Where does this lead us? 5.15 Ethics 5.16 Webscraping techniques 5.16.1 Manual 5.16.2 APIs 5.16.3 Crawling 5.17 Hands-on webscraping 5.17.1 Staging your script 5.17.2 Getting anchor data 5.17.3 Google Scholar Profiles and Publications 18 Preliminary notes 19 Getting up and running 20 Working with RScript 21 Installing additional packages 22 I dont understand the code!! 23 Reading in data files 24 Define missings 24.1 R Base 24.2 Tidy 25 Recoding variables 25.1 R Base 25.2 Tidy 26 Means and counting specific values 26.1 R Base 26.2 Tidy 27 Merging data files 27.1 R Base 27.1.1 Step1: select variables 27.1.2 Step2: make consistent 27.1.3 Step3: merge 27.1.4 Step4: check 27.1.5 Step3b: merge 27.2 Tidy 27.2.1 Step1: select variables 27.2.2 Step2: make consistent 27.2.3 Step3: merge 27.2.4 Step4: check 27.2.5 Step3b: merge 28 Aggregate data 28.1 R Base 28.2 Tidy 29 Missing values 29.1 R Base 29.1.1 Option 1: listwise deletion 29.1.2 Option 2: replacing missing values. 29.1.3 Option 3: impute missing values 29.2 Tidy 29.2.1 Option 1: listwise deletion 29.2.2 Option 2: replacing missing values. 29.2.3 Option 3: impute missing values 30 Very important stuff!! 30.1 if else 30.2 loops 30.3 Lists 30.4 lapply/map and do.call 30.5 functions 31 Assignment 32 Variance and covariance 32.1 Want to learn more?! 33 Intraclass correlation 33.1 Dyadic data 33.1.1 Describe data 33.1.2 Interdependencies: correlation 33.1.3 ICC 33.2 Egonet / Socionet data 33.2.1 Describe data 33.2.2 ICC via ML 33.2.3 ICC via SEM/lavaan # References {-} "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
